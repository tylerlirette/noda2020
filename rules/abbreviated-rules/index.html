            <p><em>*These shortened rules are great for newer players to come in and get a quicker feel for the most
                important and basic parts of dodgeball. New players quickly learn that there are a ton of rules in
                dodgeball, and you can read our complete rule list as well, but these should suffice, as all players
                will learn most rules simply through playing the game.</em></p>

            <h4>The Match</h4>
            
            <h5>SECTION 1: THE PURPOSE OF DODGEBALL</h5>
            <p>The purpose of each team is to throw balls at, catch the throws of, and dodge the throws of the opposing
                players in order to eliminate all of the players on the opposing team.</p>
            
            <hr />

            <h5>SECTION 2: THE TEAM</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>Dodgeball is played by two (2) teams, with a predetermined number of players for
                each team</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The number of players per team can vary from league to league, so please check your league for this
                    information.</li>
                <li>Teams must designate at least one captain but no more than two captains.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 2… </strong>Team captains are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Responsible for naming the team, collecting and distributing uniforms, reading weekly emails,
                    substitute players, replacement players, communicating with officials, and voting for the most
                    valuable player.</li>
                <li>The only players allowed to communicate with the officials.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            
            <h5>SECTION 3: MATCHES, GAMES, AND SCORING</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>A standard match consists of one, fifty-minute regulation time period consisting
                of a set of multiple games.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In order to start a match, both teams must have at least fifty percent (50%) of the maximum number
                    of players allowed on the court for each team. For example, if the league allows a maximum of nine
                    (9) players on the court for each team, then the minimum amount of players required to start a match
                    is five (5) players. All fractions of players are to be rounded up.</li>
                <li>A game is over when one team has had all its players eliminated from play, thus losing. The winning
                    team, with at least one player remaining, is awarded one point.</li>
                <li>At the end of each game, teams will switch sides of the court.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 2… </strong>Matches are set up by doing the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A standard match is played with a total of five, six, or seven balls - depending on type of league
                </li>
                <li>There is a "burden ball" when there is an even number of balls used in a game - the burden ball will
                    be of a different color than the other balls</li>
                <li>Balls will be placed along the courts centerline with three balls on each side of the court.</li>
                <li>Captains will play one game of rock-paper-scissors. The winner will be allowed to choose burden
                    control or court control. The option not chosen is deferred to the opposing team’s captain.</li>
                <li>Burden control is when a captain chooses which team is to start with the burden ball on their side
                    of the court.</li>
                <li>Court control is when a captain chooses the side of the court on which they wish to start.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            
            <h5>SECTION 4: TIMEOUTS</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1…</strong> Each team is allotted a single, thirty-second timeout per match.</p>
            
            <hr />

            <h5>SECTION 5: THE OPENING RUSH</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>At the start of each game, all players may participate in the opening rush.
                (<strong>See Figure 2-1</strong>)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>All players will start with both feet behind the back line. In the event that there is no back line,
                    players must have one point of physical contact with the back wall.</li>
                <li>At the signal of the official, players may only run to retrieve any balls located on the centerline
                    to their right. These balls are considered to be under their initial control. Players may not run
                    for the balls on their left side.</li>
                <li>Players may not slide or dive for balls on the opening rush.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>FIGURE 2-1: THE OPENING RUSH</h5>
            <img class="img-fluid pb-4" src="/images/rules/opening-rush.png" alt="dodgeball opening rush diagragm" />

            <p><strong>ART. 2…</strong> After the initial rush, players must establish themselves with control of their
                balls behind their attack line, so as to bring the ball legally into play.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A player has brought a ball into play when it is controlled in at least one hand, while both feet
                    are on the court and behind the attack line.</li>
                <li>Balls may be tossed to a player who is established behind the attack line.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            
            <h5>SECTION 6: BURDEN PLAY, BALL CONTROL, AND THE THROW COUNT</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>In a game where an even number of balls are used:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The team with the most balls in their possession has ball control, and thus the burden to throw,
                    until they no longer possess more balls than the opposing team.</li>
                <li>In any instance of both teams having the same number of balls, the team with the burden ball must
                    throw at least one ball.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 2…</strong> In a game where an odd number of balls are used:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The team with the most balls in their possession has ball control, and thus the burden to throw,
                    until they no longer possess more balls than the opposing team.</li>
                <li>There is no burden ball.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 3… </strong>Once a team gains ball control, that team has until a count of ten in order to
                throw the required number of balls over the centerline. A count of ten may not necessarily be equivalent
                to ten seconds.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The count will reset as soon as the team with ball control throws or rolls the required number of
                    balls over the centerline. Balls in mid-flight that have not crossed the centerline, are still
                    within the throwing team’s possession, and do not count as having been relinquished. The only
                    exception to this is when striking an opposing player that has any part of their body over the
                    centerline.</li>
                <li>Balls thrown to the opposing side that immediately come back, will not count against the ball
                    control countdown. Therefore, if it gives a team ball control again, the countdown resets. *this is
                    only after the team has thrown the appropriate number of balls.</li>
                <li>Eliminated players and players that are out of bounds may roll balls over to the other side of the
                    court in order to relinquish ball control. Players may not hold onto a ball for any amount of time
                    that is longer than necessary to throw or roll the ball over.</li>
                <li>Balls must be thrown or rolled over the centerline and reach near the opponent or the opponent’s
                    back line. Balls may not be placed by hand over the centerline.</li>
                <li>Essentially, the object is to relinquish the appropriate number of balls to give, or that would have
                    given, your opponent ball control. It’s possible to have given up enough balls, but still maintain
                    control and receive a new countdown, if new balls came into a team’s zone during the old countdown.
                    Officials may frequently yell “reset” to signal a new count in these scenarios.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            
            <h5>SECTION 7: ELIMINATION</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>Elimination by an opponent occurs when:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An opposing player throws a ball and it makes contact with the player’s body or clothes, including
                    costumes, without being caught by a player’s teammate. There is no limit to how many players can be
                    eliminated with a single ball before it becomes dead.<ol>
                        <li>A typical baseball cap (or something very similar), as well as bandanas and sweatbands, are
                            considered part of the head and not a costume. Any headgear that is bigger than these items,
                            or has long protruding or flailing parts, is considered a costume, and the player will be
                            out when struck.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>An opposing player catches a ball that was thrown by the player.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 2…</strong> Self elimination occurs when:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Touching the opposing team’s zone on the court. For example, any part of the body that touches the
                    opponent’s side of the court is considered an out.</li>
                <li>Jumping and/or dodging out of bounds.</li>
                <li>A player uses any object in the out of bounds area to maintain balance except when that object is
                    part of the boundaries (such as a back wall acting as the backline). Simply touching an object that
                    is out of bounds will not necessarily be an out, unless that object is the floor, or you were using
                    the object for some sort of advantage.</li>
                <li>The player exits the court, for any reason, when they are the last live player on their team.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 3…</strong> A legal throw occurs when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A throw involving the use of your hands and arms in a typical throwing fashion occurs.</li>
                <li>Balls that are kicked, spiked, punched, belly bumped, or pinched are not valid forms of offense.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>ART. 4…</strong> A ball is considered to be live when:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It leaves a player’s hand during a legal throw.</li>
                <li>The ball collides with a live ball thrown <em>by the same team</em> in mid-air.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 5…</strong> A live ball is considered to be dead when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The ball touches any surface or object, such as the ground, ceiling, wall, or an eliminated player.
                </li>
                <li>The ball collides with <em>an opposing player’s thrown</em> ball in mid-air.</li>
                <li>Dead balls remain dead until &nbsp;thrown by a live player.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 6…</strong> A legal catch occurs when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A player catches a live ball thrown by an opposing player.</li>
                <li>The opposing player who threw the ball is out.</li>
                <li>The first person standing in the outline of the catcher’s team is allowed to re-enter the game.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 7…</strong> A catch save occurs when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A player catches a live ball thrown by an opposing player that ricochets off of another live player
                    on the same team, thus saving their teammate that was initially hit by the opposing player’s throw.
                </li>
                <li>There is no limit to the number of players that can be hit before the ball is finally caught, which
                    will save all players with which the ball came into contact.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 8…</strong> A block occurs when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A player uses their ball to block incoming balls thrown at them by an opposing player.</li>
                <li>Players must maintain possession of their ball immediately after deflecting a live ball. If the
                    player drops a ball used for deflection, that player is out once the ball touches the floor or any
                    other object that would cause the ball to become dead.</li>
                <li>The player has the opportunity to regain possession of the ball used for blocking before it becomes
                    dead. A teammate <em>may</em> save the player by catching the ball knocked away from them.</li>
                <li>A ball that is deflected is still considered live and can eliminate players or be caught.</li>
                <li>If a player blocks a ball into themselves or a teammate, the struck player is out.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 9…</strong> A trap occurs when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A ball is caught or hits a player while simultaneously making contact with the floor or anything
                    else that would cause the ball to be dead.</li>
                <li>Traps do not count as a hit or catch and all players involved are considered safe.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 10… </strong>&nbsp;A direct headshot occurs when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A live ball’s first point of contact is the opposing player’s head.</li>
                <li>The ball is considered dead and play may be stopped at the official’s discretion when a direct
                    headshot occurs. The player is offered up to thirty seconds to compose themselves and assure the
                    officials that they are physically able to continue.</li>
                <li>Players struck in the head are considered safe even if another ball or balls contact them
                    simultaneously. They must <em>clearly</em> be hit with another ball before a direct head shot occurs
                    to be considered out.</li>
                <li>Players may protect themselves from direct headshots using their arms. They will be considered safe
                    unless the officials determine that the player attempted to catch the direct headshot, then they
                    will be called out.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 11…</strong> A flight play occurs when and results in: <strong>NOTE:</strong> For safety
                reasons, flight plays are banned in all New Orleans Dodgeball leagues with the exception of the

                    opposing player with a legal throw and subsequently landing on the opponent’s side of the court. A
                    successful flight play results in at least one out.</li>

                <li>Crossing a hard boundary or touching the opponent’s side of the court or out of bounds during
                    regular play will cause a player to be considered out.</li>
                <li>The centerline is the hard boundary that runs horizontally through the middle of the court and
                    extends beyond the sidelines in both directions. Players may cross this line only during the opening
                    rush to retrieve the balls under their initial control.</li>

                <li>Players that touch across soft boundaries with a whole foot, hand, or any part of their body are
                    considered to be out.</li>
                <li>The backlines are soft boundaries that run parallel to the centerline in the back on each side of
                    the court. <strong>NOTE: </strong>Backlines are considered hard boundaries in tournament-style

            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>The outline is the line on the right side of each team’s court in which
                eliminated players must form a line as they are eliminated.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Eliminated players must establish their position with both feet in line in the order in which they
                    <em>reach the outline</em>. The order is <em>not</em> the order in which elimination occurs.
                    Therefore, when players reach the outline, they must immediately make their way to the <em>back</em> of the
                    line and <em>not</em> try to figure out where their spot is or which player was eliminated first.</li>
                <li>Only the first person in the outline is eligible for re-entry upon a catch and must be established
                    in that position when a catch is made in order to re-enter the court. <strong>NOTE:</strong> If
                    multiple catches are made near simultaneously, before the first player re-enters the court, all the catches
                    still count and each catch gets a different player in.</li>
                <li>The first three eliminated players in the outline are considered to be locked in. They are not
                    allowed to leave the outline area for any reason. This means they are not allowed to shag on the other side
                    of the court, go to the bathroom, get a drink, etc.</li>
                <li>The last player in the line is always allowed to roam along the outlines up to the centerline in
                    order to shag balls, even if they are one of the first three in the outline.</li>
                <li>The first player in line is allowed to shag along any area of the outline that extends past the
                    backline of their court. Again, only <em>along</em> the outline area.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 2…</strong> Once a player is eliminated, they must immediately proceed to their team’s
                outline,
                located out-of-bounds to the right side of that team’s court.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An out player signifies to the court and the officials that they are out by raising their hand.</li>
                <li>An out player must drop any ball they are currently holding.</li>
                <li>An out player must immediately proceed to their outline, exiting the court to the nearest
                    out-of-bounds area to the right side of that team’s court. It is the player’s responsibility to not interfere with
                    gameplay while walking to the outline.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 3…</strong> Once a player is caught in, they may re-enter the court.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A caught-in player may only re-enter the court towards the back of their own side of the court, near
                    or on the backline.</li>
                <li>A caught-in player will be allotted a count of five to enter the game once a catch is made. It is
                    <em>not</em> the duty of the official to inform a player to come re-enter the court, and teammates
                    are encouraged to help inform their own teammates. It is also up the players at the front of the line to
                    pay attention to any actions on the court.</li>

            <h5>SECTION 9: SHAGGING</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>The act of shagging refers to any player who retrieves any ball that is out of
                bounds to make them available to live players.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A live player may only exit the court in order to shag if a ball has gone out of bounds. The player
                    may only exit via the backline or using the entry/exit zones towards the back of the court.</li>
                <li>A live player may not exit their court if there are no balls present on their side of the court in
                    the out-of-bounds area, or within a reasonable reaching distance across the centerline. Players who
                    leave the court in this situation will be considered out.</li>
                <li>A live player who is legally shagging is considered safe until they re-establish themselves on the
                    court with both feet and cannot be eliminated by a legal throw.</li>
                <li>If a live player is the last live player on their team, they cannot exit the court to shag or for
                    any other reason. If they exit, they will be considered out, and the opposing team will be declared the
                    winner of the game.</li>
