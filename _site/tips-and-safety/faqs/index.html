            <h5>What's the best way to stay up to date and find other members?</h5>
            <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/569717236480787/" target="_blank">Find Us All Here</a></p>

            <hr>

            <h5>Does the ref have to call me out if I get hit by a ball?</h5>
            <p>NO! You are ultimately responsible for taking
                your own outs. This game relies heavily on the honor code. Refs are only there to keep the pace
                of the game going, explain rules, assist with more difficult calls, and help maintain player
                safety. They are not there to make every call for you. Please keep in mind that dodgeball is an
                extremely difficult game to ref, and there will be many missed calls that you must live
                with.</p>

            <hr>

            <h5>If a ref says that we have to throw, how much time do we have?</h5>
            <p>Once a ref knows which team has ball control,
                and there are no balls out of the field of play, that team has roughly a 10 count to give up
                ball control. This is generally done with a "10-second warning" yelled out by the ref, or a ref
                telling a team they need to throw. The ref will ultimately count down the last 5 seconds. Please
                not that you do not have to throw all your balls, but just enough to have given up ball
                control.</p>

            <hr>

            <h5>Where is the outline?</h5>
            <p>The outline is always on the right side of your
                court. There will occasionally be exceptions to this rule, if a court needs to have a team lined
                up somewhere else. But, if you don't know, just assume the right side of the court.</p>

            <hr>

            <h5>How do we determine the order of the outline?</h5>
            <p>Your team lines up in the order they reach the
                outline. The order of the outline is NOT the order you are out! MOST IMPORTANTLY, you may never
                ever ever "line jump". If a member of your team is caught moving up or down the line for
                strategic reasons, your team will forfeit that game. We have absolutely zero tolerance in this
                matter. Please remain in your spot when reaching the outline. If you have already established
                your spot in the outline, feel free to leave briefly for something such as water - except if you
                are one of the first 3 in line. If the ref believes you have been gone too long, you lose your
                spot in line and will move to the end. Teams line up with the front of the outline being at the
                back of the court, and each subsequent person lining up closer to the centerline.</p>

            <hr>

            <h5>May I go retrieve balls that have left the court?</h5>
            <p>Yes. This is known as "shagging". If you are an
                active player still in the game, you must exit from the back of the court. You are not allowed
                to stall when shagging balls. You must retrieve the ball quickly and re-enter the game quickly.
                If a referee feels that you are stalling out of bounds then you may be called out. Also, the
                centerline applies to the out of bounds area, so do not cross that center line when out of
                bounds. You will be called out for crossing centerline.</p>

            <p>If you are a player that is out of the game,
                you may also shag. Please see our rules on the "outline" and "shagging" for further
                clarification.</p>

            <hr>

            <h5>Can we have teammates that are out go to the opposite side of the
                court?</h5>
            <p>Yes. You may send a maximum of 2 players to the
                opposite side of the court as official shaggers. However, once they are there, they lose their
                place in line. A player may only come back in the game off a catch if they have been established
                in the outline. Players going to shag may not return to the game while on that side of the
                court.</p>

            <hr>

            <h5>What are those other lines for that are close to, and run parallel
                to, the center line?</h5>
            <p>These are called "attack lines". For most of
                our leagues, these lines only matter on the initial rush. After retrieving the balls on the
                opening rush, any ball may not be thrown until it is held by a player that has both feet fully
                established behind that line. Yes, you may toss the ball back to a player already established
                behind the line. After the initial rush, these lines mean nothing and you are allowed to move up
                to the center line to throw.</p>

            <hr>

            <h5>What's up with tie matches?</h5>
            <p>Yes. This does not happen often, but we do not
                have a tiebreaker system in place for regular season matches. Gyms are on a strict schedule, and
                we try to optimize everyone's playing time. 50-minute matches are the maximum length we can give
                to stay on schedule, and to not delay other teams' games. The only other option would be to make
                your matches shorter.</p>

            <p>A match ends in a tie if both teams have won
                the same exact amount of games by the time the 50 minutes are up. Once that final whistle blows,
                if there is still a game in progress, that game is declared void and we use the final score as
                of the last completed game. No, the team with the most people left on the court does not get the
                victory.</p>

            <hr>

            <h5>Which balls do I run for at the beginning of the game?</h5>
            <p>Generally, only run for the balls on your right side of the centerline.</p>

            <hr>

            <h5>What happens if I get hit in the head?</h5>
            <p>If it's a direct headshot (the ball touches
                nothing before it makes impact with your head), then you are safe. However, you are out should
                any part of your body be touching the ground other than your own 2 feet or you are in active
                dodging position (crouching, for example). If the ball bounces off a live teammate, then hits
                your head, you are out. If you block a ball into your own head, then you are out. For more info
                on headshots, please see the rules page.</p>

            <hr>

            <h5>Why aren't some players not taking their outs when they get hit?</h5>
            <p>This is tricky. Many many many times you will
                think that a player got hit, when they really didn't. With so many balls flying so fast, and so
                many close calls happening, there are bound to be a handful of plays that trick our eyes. Trust
                us when we say that you will be wrong on many occasions when you think someone is "cheating"
                their out. However, we will concede that there are bad apples out there too. It's frowned upon,
                but players that do it are also putting themselves in a position to be watched more if they have
                a bad reputation. As well, players that blatantly cheat obvious outs frequently will be
                penalized. Finally, sometimes it's just really hard to tell if a ball hit a player first or
                something like the ground first. In fact, that scenario is probably the most frequent one that
                brings on complaints; whether a ball hit the ground or the player first. Those are often hard to
                judge and sometimes the players and refs honestly just don't know. And if it's too tough to
                determine, the refs err on the side of "safe".</p>
