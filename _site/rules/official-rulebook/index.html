            <h5>SECTION 1: THE PURPOSE OF DODGEBALL</h5>

            <p>The purpose of each team is to throw balls at, catch
                the throws of, and dodge the throws of the opposing players in order to eliminate all of
                the players on the opposing team.</p>

            <hr />
            
            <h5>SECTION 2: THE TEAM</h5>

            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>Dodgeball is played by two (2) teams of nine (9) players
                each.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The maximum number of active players on a roster
                    is twelve (12) per team.</li>
                <li>Teams must have a minimum of two female players on the court each game, but may have
                    more than two. For each female player not present in a starting lineup, one male
                    player must also leave the starting lineup. For example, if a team of nine (9)
                    players only has one female in their starting lineup, the team may only have seven
                    (7) players in their starting lineup, six (6) males and one female. If a team of
                    nine (9) players has no females in their starting lineup, the team may only have
                    five (5) players in their starting lineup, five (5) males.3</li>
                <li>Teams must designate at least one captain but no
                    more than two captains.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 2… </strong>Team captains are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Responsible for naming the team, collecting and
                    distributing uniforms, reading weekly emails, substitute players, replacement
                    players, communicating with officials, and voting for the most valuable player.</li>
                <li>The only players allowed to communicate with the
                    officials.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: ILLEGAL SUBSTITUTION… </strong>An illegal substitution occurs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-2-1B</strong>, when a team plays more male players than
                    are allowed by rule. <strong>RULING:</strong> The team shall forfeit only the games
                    within a match in which an illegal player has participated. Forfeitures can and will
                    be applied retroactively. Retroactive game forfeitures may or may not result in a
                    new outcome for the match played, depending on what the new score would be.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT… </strong>Unsportsmanlike conduct:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-2-2B</strong>, when a player other than the captain
                    communicates with an official. <strong>RULING: </strong>On the first occurrence, it
                    is recommended that the offending player receive a warning. On the subsequent
                    occurrences, the offending player will be issued a card of which the severity can be
                    determined by the official as deemed necessary.</li>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-2-2B</strong>, when a captain argues with an official for
                    an extended period of time deemed unnecessary by an official.
                    <strong>RULING:</strong> The offending player(s) will be issued at least a warning,
                    and, if necessary, a card of which the severity can be determined by the official.
                </li>
            </ol>
        
            <hr />
            
            <h5>SECTION 3: MATCHES, GAMES, AND SCORING</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>A standard match consists of one, fifty-minute regulation time
                period consisting of a set of multiple games.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In order to start a match, both teams must have at least fifty percent (50%) of the
                    maximum number of players allowed on the court for each team. For example, if the
                    league allows a maximum of nine (9) players on the court for each team, then the
                    minimum amount of players required to start a match is five (5) players. All
                    fractions of players are to be rounded up.</li>
                <li>A game is over when one team has had all its players eliminated from play, thus
                    losing. The winning team, with at least one player remaining, is awarded one point.
                </li>
                <li>In the event of a one-on-one scenario, if both players throw a ball and <em>hit</em>
                    each other, both players are out regardless of which player was hit first. The game
                    ends in a draw and neither team is awarded one point. A new match is started with no
                    points awarded to either team.</li>
                <li>In the event of a one-on-one scenario, if both players throw a ball and catch each
                    other’s throw, the player who catches the opponent’s ball first is awarded the
                    catch, while the player that catches the ball last can not have a legal catch since
                    they have already been eliminated from play. This results in the game being over,
                    and the first catcher’s team being the winner. <em>It must be clear that one catch
                        happened before the other in this rare scenario</em>. If the catches occur
                    simultaneously, both players are out, while the next player in the the outline for
                    each team comes back into play.</li>
                <li>At the end of each game, teams will switch sides of the court.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 2… </strong>Matches are set up by doing the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A standard match is played with a total of six balls, five balls and one burden
                    ball.</li>
                <li>The burden ball will be of a different color than the other balls.</li>
                <li>Balls will be placed along the courts centerline with three balls on each side of
                    the court.</li>
                <li>The burden ball will remain on the same side of the court at setup throughout the
                    entire match.</li>
                <li>The team that starts with the burden each game may have a captain instruct the
                    official to place the balls in a certain order as desired.</li>
                <li>Captains will play one game of rock-paper-scissors. The winner will be allowed to
                    choose burden control or court control. The option not chosen is deferred to the
                    opposing team’s captain.</li>
                <li>Burden control is when a captain chooses which team is to start with the burden ball
                    on their side of the court.</li>
                <li>Court control is when a captain chooses the side of the court on which they wish to
                    start.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            
            <h5>SECTION 4: TIMEOUTS</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1…</strong> Each team is allotted a single, thirty-second timeout per match.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Team captains are the only player who can call a timeout and can do so at any time.
                </li>
                <li>Timeouts officially begin when the official acknowledges the captain’s request
                    <em>and signals for play to stop</em>. At this point, the clock stops and all balls
                    are considered dead, even if in flight.</li>
                <li>During a timeout, eliminated captains may step on the court to address any live
                    players. Players in the outline who are not captains are not allowed onto the court.
                </li>
                <li>Timeouts officially end when the official signals for play to begin. Before the
                    official signals for play to resume, all live players must be behind their back
                    line.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            
            <h5>SECTION 5: THE OPENING RUSH</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>At the start of each game, all players may participate in the
                opening rush. (<strong>See Figure 2-1</strong>)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>All players will start with both feet behind the back line. In the event that there
                    is no back line, players must have one point of physical contact with the back wall.
                </li>
                <li>At the signal of the official, players may only run to retrieve any balls located on
                    the centerline to their right. These balls are considered to be under their initial
                    control. Players may not run for the balls on their left side.</li>
                <li>Players may not slide or dive for balls on the opening rush.</li>
                <li>Players <em>may</em> cross the centerline only on the initial rush in order to
                    retrieve the balls under their initial control.</li>
                <li>Players may retrieve balls under the initial control of their opponents only if
                    their team has cleared all of the balls under their initial control past their
                    attack line. They may reach across the centerline but may not cross the centerline
                    in order to retrieve an opponent’s ball.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>FIGURE 2-1: THE OPENING RUSH</h5>
            <img class="img-fluid pb-4" src="/images/rules/opening-rush.png" alt="dodgeball opening rush diagragm" />

            <p><strong>PENALTY: FALSE START… </strong>A false start violation occurs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-5-1A</strong>, when a player or players enter the court to
                    retrieve their balls on the opening rush before the official’s signal.
                    <strong>RULING: </strong>On the first occurrence, it is recommended that all players
                    reset and the opening rush starts over. On the second occurrence, it is recommended
                    that the opening rush resets with all new players running for the balls for the
                    offending team(s). On the third occurrence all offending players are called out,
                    play is not stopped, and balls must still be retrieved.</li>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-5-1C</strong>, when a player or players slide or dive to
                    retrieve their balls on the the opening rush. <strong>RULING: </strong>On the first
                    occurrence, it is recommended that the offending player receive a warning and the
                    game is reset to start again. On the subsequent occurrences, the offending player
                    may be issued a card of which the severity can be determined by the official as
                    deemed necessary.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: ILLEGAL TOUCHING… </strong>An illegal touching violation occurs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-5-1B, 1E</strong>, when a player touches or retrieves a
                    ball that is not under their initial control during the opening rush, and their own
                    team’s balls have not yet cleared the attack line - these violating balls are
                    usually located on the left side of the centerline, and belong to the opposing team.
                    <strong>RULING:</strong> Play is immediately stopped. All of the balls that are
                    illegally touched are awarded to the opposing team. Play resumes on the official’s
                    signal. However, if a player continuously does this, that player will immediately be
                    called out after each subsequent occurrence.</li>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-8-1D</strong>, when a player crosses the centerline to
                    shag a ball. <strong>RULING:</strong> All shagged balls are awarded to the opposing
                    team. If the player that crossed the centerline was an active player, that player is
                    also called out.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 2…</strong> After the initial rush, players must establish themselves with
                control of their balls behind their attack line, so as to bring the ball legally into
                play.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A player has brought a ball into play when it is controlled in at least one hand,
                    while both feet are on the court and behind the attack line.</li>
                <li>Balls may be tossed to a player who is established behind the attack line.</li>

            <h5>SECTION 6: BURDEN PLAY, BALL CONTROL, AND THE THROW COUNT</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>In a game where an even number of balls are used:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The team with the most balls in their possession has ball control, and thus the
                    burden to throw, until they no longer possess more balls than the opposing team.
                </li>
                <li>In any instance of both teams having the same number of balls, the team with the
                    burden ball must throw at least one ball.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 2…</strong> In a game where an odd number of balls are used:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The team with the most balls in their possession has ball control, and thus the
                    burden to throw, until they no longer possess more balls than the opposing team.
                </li>
                <li>There is no burden ball.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 3… </strong>Once a team gains ball control, that team has until a count of
                ten in order to throw the required number of balls over the centerline. A count of ten
                may not necessarily be equivalent to ten seconds.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The count will reset as soon as the team with ball control throws or rolls the
                    required number of balls over the centerline. Balls in mid-flight that have not
                    crossed the centerline, are still within the throwing team’s possession, and do not
                    count as having been relinquished. The only exception to this is when striking an
                    opposing player that has any part of their body over the centerline.</li>
                <li>Balls thrown to the opposing side that immediately come back, will not count against
                    the ball control countdown. Therefore, if it gives a team ball control again, the
                    countdown resets. *this is only after the team has thrown the appropriate number of
                    balls.</li>
                <li>Eliminated players and players that are out of bounds may roll balls over to the
                    other side of the court in order to relinquish ball control. Players may not hold
                    onto a ball for any amount of time that is longer than necessary to throw or roll
                    the ball over.</li>
                <li>Balls must be thrown or rolled over the centerline and reach near the opponent or
                    the opponent’s back line. Balls may not be placed by hand over the centerline.</li>
                <li>Essentially, the object is to relinquish the appropriate number of balls to give, or
                    that would have given, your opponent ball control. It’s possible to have given up
                    enough balls, but still maintain control and receive a new countdown, if new balls
                    came into a team’s zone during the old countdown. Officials may frequently yell
                    “reset” to signal a new count in these scenarios.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: THROW COUNT VIOLATION…</strong> A throw count violation occurs,
                concerning <strong>Rule 2-6-3</strong>, when the count of ten expires before the team
                with ball control fails to relinquish the required number of balls. <strong>RULING:
                </strong>All of the balls from the team with ball control will be awarded to the
                opposing team and a new count of ten begins.</p>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: DELAY OF GAME… </strong>A delay of game violation occurs when a player
                attempts to lure a player forward by putting any balls on their side of the court, out
                of reach of the opponent. <strong>RULING:</strong> The game is stopped and the ball is
                awarded to the opposing team. On the subsequent occurrences, all balls will be awarded
                to the opposing team, and, if the official deems it necessary, may call the violating
                player out, stop the clock, and/or reset time at the end of a match.</p>

            <h5>SECTION 7: ELIMINATION</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>Elimination by an opponent occurs when:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An opposing player throws a ball and it makes contact with the player’s body or
                    clothes, including costumes, without being caught by a player’s teammate. There is
                    no limit to how many players can be eliminated with a single ball before it becomes
                    dead.<ol>
                        <li>A typical baseball cap (or something very similar), as well as bandanas and
                            sweatbands, are considered part of the head and not a costume. Any headgear
                            that is bigger than these items, or has long protruding or flailing parts,
                            is considered a costume, and the player will be out when struck.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>An opposing player catches a ball that was thrown by the player.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 2…</strong> Self elimination occurs when:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Touching the opposing team’s zone on the court. For example, any part of the body
                    that touches the opponent’s side of the court is considered an out.</li>
                <li>Jumping and/or dodging out of bounds.</li>
                <li>A player uses any object in the out of bounds area to maintain balance except when
                    that object is part of the boundaries (such as a back wall acting as the backline).
                    Simply touching an object that is out of bounds will not necessarily be an out,
                    unless that object is the floor, or you were using the object for some sort of
                    advantage.</li>
                <li>The player exits the court, for any reason, when they are the last live player on
                    their team.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 3…</strong> A legal throw occurs when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A throw involving the use of your hands and arms in a typical throwing fashion
                    occurs.</li>
                <li>Balls that are kicked, spiked, punched, belly bumped, or pinched are not valid forms
                    of offense.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: PINCHING… </strong>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-7-3</strong>, a pinching
                violation occurs when a playing holding a ball grasps it hard enough so that the rubber
                from one side of the ball touches the other side of the ball. Open hand and clamping
                grips are acceptable forms of holding the ball. <strong>RULING: </strong>On the first
                occurrence, it is recommended that the offending player receive a warning. On the second
                occurrence, the player is called out. On the subsequent occurrences, the offending
                player will be called out, and issued a card of which the severity can be determined by
                the official as deemed necessary. (<strong>See Figure 2-2</strong>)</p>

            <p><strong>ART. 4…</strong> A ball is considered to be live when:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It leaves a player’s hand during a legal throw.</li>
                <li>The ball collides with a live ball thrown <em>by the same team</em> in mid-air.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 5…</strong> A live ball is considered to be dead when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The ball touches any surface or object, such as the ground, ceiling, wall, or an
                    eliminated player.</li>
                <li>The ball collides with <em>an opposing player’s thrown</em> ball in mid-air.</li>
                <li>Dead balls remain dead until &nbsp;thrown by a live player.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 6…</strong> A legal catch occurs when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A player catches a live ball thrown by an opposing player.</li>
                <li>The opposing player who threw the ball is out.</li>
                <li>The first person standing in the outline of the catcher’s team is allowed to
                    re-enter the game.</li>
                <li>A catch is only valid if both of the catching player’s feet are clearly established
                    in bounds.</li>
                <li>If the player’s momentum carries them out of bounds after a legal catch is made,
                    they are considered to be safe. This is commonly referred to as the momentum rule.
                </li>
                <li>The player must clearly demonstrate control of the ball before releasing it.</li>
                <li>If the catching player catches a ball, but that ball knocks another ball out of the
                    catching player’s hand(s), the catch still counts; however, the player is out for
                    dropping their other ball.</li>
                <li>A player may intentionally drop a ball in their possession in anticipation of a
                    catch.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 7…</strong> A catch save occurs when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A player catches a live ball thrown by an opposing player that ricochets off of
                    another live player on the same team, thus saving their teammate that was initially
                    hit by the opposing player’s throw.</li>
                <li>There is no limit to the number of players that can be hit before the ball is
                    finally caught, which will save all players with which the ball came into contact.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 8…</strong> A block occurs when and results in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A player uses their ball to block incoming balls thrown at them by an opposing
                    player.</li>
                <li>Players must maintain possession of their ball immediately after deflecting a live
                    ball. If the player drops a ball used for deflection, that player is out once the
                    ball touches the floor or any other object that would cause the ball to become dead.
                </li>
                <li>The player has the opportunity to regain possession of the ball used for blocking
                    before it becomes dead. A teammate <em>may</em> save the player by catching the ball
                    knocked away from them.</li>
                <li>A ball that is deflected is still considered live and can eliminate players or be
                    caught.</li>
                <li>If a player blocks a ball into themselves or a teammate, the struck player is out.
                </li>
                <li>Any live ball that is blocked or ricocheted back to the opposing team’s side of the
                    court is considered dead once it touches anything that would usually make a ball
                    dead or a player on the opposing team. The ball cannot be caught or hit a player out
                    in this scenario.</li>

                <li>A live ball’s first point of contact is the opposing player’s head.</li>
                <li>The ball is considered dead and play may be stopped at the official’s discretion
                    when a direct headshot occurs. The player is offered up to thirty seconds to compose
                    themselves and assure the officials that they are physically able to continue.</li>
                <li>Players struck in the head are considered safe even if another ball or balls contact
                    them simultaneously. They must <em>clearly</em> be hit with another ball before a
                    direct head shot occurs to be considered out.</li>
                <li>Players may protect themselves from direct headshots using their arms. They will be
                    considered safe unless the officials determine that the player attempted to catch
                    the direct headshot, then they will be called out.</li>
                <li>A ball caught against a player’s face is not considered a headshot and will count as
                    a catch; however, if a ball ricochets from a player’s direct headshot and is caught
                    by that same player or a teammate, that ball is considered dead and will not count
                    as a catch.</li>

                targeting the heads of opposing players, or attempting to injure another player.
                <strong>RULING: </strong>The offending player will first be warned, but on subsequent
                occurrences may be issued a card, of which the severity can be determined by the
                official as deemed necessary. <strong>NOTE:</strong> An official may card without
                warning should it be deemed necessary to do so.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>ART. 11…</strong> A flight play occurs when and results in:

                <li>In the event of a successful flight play, the player who made the attempt is
                    considered safe even though they are now across the centerline. An unsuccessful
                    attempt results in the player being called out.</li>
                <li>Once a successful flight play has been made, the player must immediately return to
                    their side of the court. They can still be eliminated by a legal throw; however,
                    they cannot make a legal catch or throw until they reestablish themselves on their
                    side of the court. As well, they may not interfere with play, or touch any balls
                    until they reestablish themselves on their side of the court. Doing any of the above
                    results in an out.</li>

            <p><strong>PENALTY: ILLEGAL THROW… </strong>An illegal throw violation occurs, concerning
                <strong>Rule 2-7-11</strong>, when a player attempts a flight play in a non-sanctioned
                league. <strong>RULING:</strong> The player is out, regardless of whether or not the
                attempt is successful, and the ball they have thrown is considered dead. Neither hits
                nor catches of this ball count.</p>
            <p><strong>ART. 12… </strong>A hard boundary is a line on the dodgeball court that cannot be

                <li>The centerline is the hard boundary that runs horizontally through the middle of the
                    court and extends beyond the sidelines in both directions. Players may cross this
                    line only during the opening rush to retrieve the balls under their initial control.

            <p><strong>ART. 13… </strong>A soft boundary is a line on the dodgeball court that can
                partially be crossed. (<strong>See Figure 2-4</strong>)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Players may touch across soft boundaries with a partial <em>foot</em> (and only a
                    partial <em>foot</em>) - or <em>feet</em> - and still be considered in bounds.</li>
                <li>Players that touch across soft boundaries with a whole foot, hand, or any part of
                    their body are considered to be out.</li>
                <li>The backlines are soft boundaries that run parallel to the centerline in the back on
                    each side of the court. <strong>NOTE: </strong>Backlines are considered hard
                    boundaries in tournament-style leagues.</li>
                <li>The sidelines are soft boundaries that run perpendicularly to the centerline and

            <h5>SECTION 8: THE OUTLINE, GAME RE-ENTRY, AND ENTERING OR EXITING THE COURT</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>The outline is the line on the right side of each team’s court in
                which eliminated players must form a line as they are eliminated.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Eliminated players must establish their position with both feet in line in the order in
                    which they <em>reach the outline</em>. The order is <em>not</em> the order in which
                    elimination occurs. Therefore, when players reach the outline, they must immediately make
                    their way to the <em>back</em> of the line and <em>not</em> try to figure out where their
                    spot is or which player was eliminated first.</li>
                <li>Only the first person in the outline is eligible for re-entry upon a catch and must be
                    established in that position when a catch is made in order to re-enter the court.
                    <strong>NOTE:</strong> If multiple catches are made near simultaneously, before the first
                    player re-enters the court, all the catches still count and each catch gets a different
                    player in.</li>
                <li>The first three eliminated players in the outline are considered to be locked in. They are
                    not allowed to leave the outline area for any reason. This means they are not allowed to
                    shag on the other side of the court, go to the bathroom, get a drink, etc.</li>
                <li>The last player in the line is always allowed to roam along the outlines up to the
                    centerline in order to shag balls, even if they are one of the first three in the outline.
                </li>
                <li>The first player in line is allowed to shag along any area of the outline that extends
                    past the backline of their court. Again, only <em>along</em> the outline area.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: OUTLINE VIOLATION… </strong>An outline violation occurs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-8-1A, 1B</strong>, when a player that is first in the outline is
                    not present when a ball is caught by their team. <strong>RULING:</strong> The player
                    forfeits their ability to re-enter the court for the current catch and must move to the
                    back of the line. Furthermore, the next player in line is not allowed to re-enter the game
                    in place of the absent player.</li>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-8-1A, 1B</strong>, when a player that is first in the outline
                    fails to notice the catch and re-enter the court within a count of five. <strong>RULING:
                    </strong>The player forfeits their ability to re-enter the court for the current catch,
                    must move to the back of the line, and the next player in line may not re-enter the game
                    in place of that player for that catch.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: INTERFERENCE…</strong> Interference occurs when an eliminated player reaches
                onto the court for any reason. <strong>RULING: </strong>The ball or balls interfered with will
                be awarded to the opposing team. The offending player may be issued a card of which the
                severity can be determined by the official as deemed necessary, only if this is determined to
                be a recurring issue.</p>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT… </strong>Unsportsmanlike conduct occurs, concerning
                <strong>Rule 2-8-1A</strong>, when a player has changed places with a person in the line in
                order to gain an advantage. This is commonly referred to as line jumping. <strong>RULING:
                </strong>The game is forfeited and one point is awarded to the opposing team. The offending
                player(s) may be issued a card of which the severity can be determined by the official as
                deemed necessary.</p>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: ILLEGAL TOUCHING… </strong>An illegal touching violation occurs, concerning
                <strong>Rule 2-8-1D</strong>, when a player crosses the centerline to shag a ball.
                <strong>RULING:</strong> All shagged balls are awarded to the opposing team. If the player
                that crossed the centerline was an active player, that player is also called out.</p>
            <p><strong>ART. 2…</strong> Once a player is eliminated, they must immediately proceed to their
                team’s outline, located out-of-bounds to the right side of that team’s court.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An out player signifies to the court and the officials that they are out by raising their
                    hand.</li>
                <li>An out player must drop any ball they are currently holding.</li>
                <li>An out player must immediately proceed to their outline, exiting the court to the nearest
                    out-of-bounds area to the right side of that team’s court. It is the player’s
                    responsibility to not interfere with gameplay while walking to the outline.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 3…</strong> Once a player is caught in, they may re-enter the court.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A caught-in player may only re-enter the court towards the back of their own side of the
                    court, near or on the backline.</li>
                <li>A caught-in player will be allotted a count of five to enter the game once a catch is
                    made. It is <em>not</em> the duty of the official to inform a player to come re-enter the
                    court, and teammates are encouraged to help inform their own teammates. It is also up the
                    players at the front of the line to pay attention to any actions on the court.</li>
                <li>A caught-in player becomes live when they become established on the court <em>with both
                        feet.</em></li>
                <li>Once a player has at least a partial foot touching in bounds, they are considered to have
                    begun the process of game re-entry.</li>
                <li>Once the player has begun game re-entry, they must continue the game re-entry, and may not
                    step back out of bounds or even pause.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: INTERFERENCE… </strong>An interference violation occurs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>When an eliminated player swats, kicks, or otherwise blocks an incoming ball when exiting
                    the court. <strong>RULING:</strong> Play is stopped and all balls from the offending
                    player’s team will be forfeited to the opposing team. Should there be no balls in
                    possession of the offending player’s team, play is stopped, all balls are returned to the
                    opposing team, and a official may yellow card the offending player.</li>
                <li>When an eliminated player makes deliberate contact with a ball not thrown by an opponent
                    during their exit of the court. <strong>RULING: </strong>The ball or balls interfered with
                    will be awarded to the opposing team. The offending player may be warned if it becomes a
                    recurring issue, then subsequently yellow carded.</li>
                <li>When an eliminated player is deemed by an official to be exiting the court too slowly.
                    <strong>RULING: </strong>The offending player will be warned. Each subsequent occurrence
                    may result in one of the following, as the official sees fit:<ol>
                        <li>Official stopping play and awarding all balls to the opposing team.</li>
                        <li>Official granting a ball control reset for the opposing team.</li>
                        <li>Official adding time to the end of a match due to stalling purposes.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>When an eliminated or active player who is out of bounds and/or in the outline touches a
                    live player for a strategic advantage; such as to prevent the live player from falling out
                    of bounds. <strong>RULING: </strong>The live player is called out.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>PENALTY: ILLEGAL RE-ENTRY…</strong> An Illegal re-entry violation occurs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-8-3A</strong>, when a player enters the court from any other
                    location than towards the back of their own side of the court, near or on the backline.
                    This includes the middle or front of the sideline and the side of the court opposite of
                    the team’s outline. <strong>RULING:</strong> The player is called out and returns to the
                    end of the outline and not their former place at the front of the line.</li>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-8-3B</strong>, when a player fails to re-enter the court within
                    the allotted count of five. <strong>RULING:</strong> The player is called out and returns
                    to the end of the outline and not their former place at the front of the line.</li>
                <li>Concerning <strong>Rule 2-8-3C</strong>, when a player starts and then pauses, stops, or
                    fails to complete the reentry process for any reason, including to avoid a thrown ball or
                    bait the opposing team into throwing. <strong>RULING:</strong> The player is called out
                    and returns to the end of the outline and not their former place at the front of the line.

            <ol>
                <li>A live player may only exit the court in order to shag if a ball has gone out of bounds.
                    The player may only exit via the backline or using the entry/exit zones towards the back
                    of the court.</li>
                <li>A live player may not exit their court if there are no balls present on their side of the
                    court in the out-of-bounds area, or within a reasonable reaching distance across the
                    centerline. Players who leave the court in this situation will be considered out.</li>
                <li>A live player who is legally shagging is considered safe until they re-establish

            <p>Dodgeball is <em>always</em> played on the honor code. You are responsible for taking your own
                outs, and you must not have a “stay in until the ref calls it” attitude. Doing so will result

            <h5>SECTION 2: THE HEAD OFFICIAL AND REFEREE</h5>
            <p><strong>ART. 1…</strong> An official or referee is anyone that is assigned to a match by the
                league manager.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The head official is in charge of the game, makes the final determination on the validity
                    of calls, and all their calls are final. The head official for each match will be
                    determined by the league manager and/or the head of officiating.</li>
                <li>The referee is any official other than the head official assigned to a match. Their
                    authority on the court is second only to the head official.</li>
                <li>Referees are assigned to games to keep the pace of the game going, assist in: difficult
                    rulings, explaining and evaluating more complex scenarios, and anything that is a
                    less-than-obvious-ruling. They are also there to help keep time, keep score, perform
                    countdowns, and maintain the peace.</li>

            <p><strong>ART. 1… </strong>Before the match begins</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The head official checks with both teams for substitute players. Their names are recorded
                    and fees are collected.</li>
                <li>The captains are called to center court. They play rock-paper-scissors. The winner is
                    awarded either ball control or court control at their discretion. The remaining option is
                    deferred to the opposing team’s captain.</li>
                <li>The head official informs the captain of all pertinent information, such as any points of
                    emphasis and the allotted time for regulation play.</li>
                <li>Duties are assigned to each referee by the head official. Key duties are as follows:<ol>
                        <li>The keeping of the score on the official game sheet and scoreboard where
                            available.</li>
                        <li>The keeping of time.</li>
                        <li>The monitoring of the count of ten for burden play.</li>
                        <li>In a single official configuration, the head official stand on either side of the
                            court at the centerline.</li>
                        <li>In a two official configuration, the head official and referee will stand at
                            opposite ends of the centerline.</li>
                        <li>In configurations of three or more officials, officials may either roam or be
                            assigned to a position at the head officials discretion.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The head official and referee are to check the starting line up of each team before
                    beginning the match and each subsequent game.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>ART. 2…</strong> During the match</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Officials are to enforce the rules of dodgeball.</li>
                <li>The count of ten begins as soon as all balls are accounted for and are in bounds either on
                    the playing surface or in possession of a player. If teams appear to be moving too slowly
                    to retrieve a ball out of bounds, any official can and should begin the count of ten.</li>
                <li>If any ball(s) can not be found, an official timeout is called to attempt to retrieve it
                    in a timely manner. If it can not be retrieved in a timely manner, the ball is replaced
                    with a new ball from the league stock.</li>
                <li>It is not the responsibility of the official to inform players of how many balls must be
                    relinquished during burden play, but it is a courtesy.</li>
                <li>Officials are to prioritize the correct call over getting the call right the first time.
                    Conferences between officials during controversial situations are encouraged. We expect
                    officials to attempt to limit these conferences earlier in matches and games, so as to
                    keep the pace of the game going. However, later in games and matches it is thought to be
                    more important for such conferences.</li>
                <li>Any time an official blows the whistle or steps on the court, play is immediately stopped.
                    All balls are dead, including those in mid-air.<ol>
                        <li>Should there be balls that were in mid-air, or thrown near simultaneous to the
                            whistle, and became dead, those balls are to be returned to the team that threw
                            them.</li>
                        <li>No play shall ever be stopped by the players, so even if a player feels that play
                            may need to be stopped, it will not be until the officials blow the whistle or
                            step on the court. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Very rarely there may be circumstances
                            that this rule is overturned, such as a severe injury that was not immediately
                            noticed by an official. This can be at the official’s discretion to rule on, but
                            in actuality all players should also understand a sense of fairness in extreme
                            situations.</li>

                    center court to explain the rules of overtime and the allotted time for overtime play.
                </li>
                <li>Once the match has ended, the head official with have the captain of each team sign the
                    official game sheet.</li>
                <li>Should any situation arise during the match that any official feels is not covered or
                    properly explained in this rule book, it is to be logged on the official game sheet and
                    communicated to the head of officiating or league manager.</li>

                    rulings.</li>

                    the team with the best head-to-head result between them will receive the higher seed. If
                    three or more teams are tied, then the seeding is ordered according to the win percentage
                    of all matches between the tied teams. If a team did not play any of the other teams it is
                    tied with, their win percentage for the tie breaker will be zero.</li>
                <li>Overall game differential. This is determined by taking the number of games a team has won
                    within all of its matches, then subtracting it by the number of games that team has lost.
                    The highest game differential will receive the higher seed.<ol>

                            GD. <strong>NOTE:</strong> With the change in tiebreaker procedures, GD carries a
                            far lesser importance in the standings. We understand that if a game had been
                            played, this number could be vastly different, but please understand we are going
