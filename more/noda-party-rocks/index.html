            <h5>NODA's Seasonal Parties</h5>
            <p>At the end of every season, we throw down a big party for all the leagues to come together. Awards & prizes are handed out, cheap drinks consumed, and many a game is played.</p>
            <p>We have partied at Carrollton Station, Cooter Browns, Rusty Nail, Rendezvous Tavern, Rendon Inn, Bayou St. John, The Fly, and more. From our Splash Bash 2016 water balloon fight and shrimp boil to our Annual Ugly Sweater Holiday Party, we throw down like only a family can.</p>

            <h5>NODA's Dodgefam Travels Together</h5>
            <p>Since we're family, why not go places together? Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Florida, and Texas are just some of our adventures. Plenty more are to come, especially now that we have several competitive traveling teams that will be going from tournament to tournament across the country, and even abroad!</p>
            <p>Stay up to date on USA Dodgeball, as you can be sure to find  some of us there, taking our game to the next level.</p>
